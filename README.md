       Now then,
       Lets Move on to the installation process now...



Installation:
--------------

Its quiet easy if i say so myself. infact just one piece of code to install all tools required to run this program

---> First, Give executable abilities to the installer using the code (You only need to do this once)::

chmod +x install.sh             

---> Now that you've given the executable permissions, You can now start the installation process itself by typing the command:

./install.sh

---> The updated install script automates the process of giving permissions to all the required files in the program, saving you time!

---> After that, you should get a message saying Installation complete and now you're ready to run the program itself
     In-order to run the program whenever u need it to...run the command:

./myphone1.sh

Enjoy the program...
